### Setting up a Test Environment
1. Create a Discord server which will serve as your test server
    * Click Add a Server at the very bottom of your Discord server list panel

    * Give it a name and press Create

    * Navigate to the OAuth2 tab in the Side Panel and select bot in the Scopes section. Scroll down and select the desired permissions for the bot user - the example ones as shown on the picture attached below should suffice.

    * Copy the generated link from the Scopes section and paste it in your browser of choice. Select your test server as the server you want to add the bot user to and press Continue.

3. Set up the project locally
    * Fork this repository on GitHub and clone it to somewhere on your computer
    * Navigate to the project's folder in the command line
    * Check out to a new branch
    * Install the required dependencies by running ```npm i```
    * Create an ```.env``` file in the root folder
    * Inside of the ```.env``` file, create a ```TOKEN``` variable and set it to the Token you copied from your Bot page, e.g. ```TOKEN=YOURTOKENGOESHERE```
    * The project should be functional at this point. Try running ```npm start``` - if you get any errors, you probably skipped a step.
